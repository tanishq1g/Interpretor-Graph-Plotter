# Interpretor-Graph-Plotter

we made an interpreter which could perform all the functions a scientific calculator would perform you just had to enter the mathematical statement or your query , apart from that you could enter equations under two variable two have their graphs plotted on the side screen which was also part of the project. multiple graphs could be plotted on the panel. also you could draw on the panel similar to what you do on paint which could be used to maybe highlight important points or information of the graph. you could also change the colour of your graphs. project was made to be very user friendly and detailed graphics were added to it.
